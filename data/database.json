Since june 2025, I'm learning Godot, a more complex game engine. Curious about Cybersecurity, I explored a lot of Linux distributions such as linux Mint, Kali or Tails, and aquired some basic knowledge in OSINT with tools like Sherlock, or just simply Google. Since I started Web Dev in January 2026 I am beginning to enjoy it to a point where I am even thinking to maybe work in this field, instead of doing cybersecurity. In parallel of Informational technologies, I have a lot of other interests such as music, magic tricks, and sport. I am now at my first year in 'École IT', an IT school,  and I always search for new knowledge and opportunities !"
